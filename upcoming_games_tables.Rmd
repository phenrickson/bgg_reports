# What is this? {-}

What upcoming games on boardgamegeek are expected to be popular? 

I trained a variety of models on historical data from BGG in order to make predictions for upcoming games. My models look at information about games that are known at the time of release - mechanics, player count, playingtime, designer, artist, and selected publishers - and estimates four outcomes on BGG: average weight (complexity), average rating, number of user ratings, and geek rating. I trained the models on games published through 2020 in order to predict upcoming games, which for now refers to games published from 2021 onwards.

For more details on my methodology, see my write up at:
https://phenrickson.github.io/bgg_reports/predicting_bgg_outcomes.html

# Predicting Upcoming Games

This table displays the model's **estimates** for four different outcomes for all upcoming games: Weight (complexity), UserRatings, Average, and GeekRating. The table below shows the top 25 games with the highest expected geek rating, but can be sorted and filtered based on outcome or year.

The model's estimates are based only on information in a game's profile (categories, mechanics, playingtime, publisher, designer), and do not use information on how the games are currently rated on BGG.
